**Abstract**

The proposed PPG quality assessment method includes three parts: 1) filtering, 2) feature extraction, and 3) clustering. The method, enabled by an elliptical envelope, requires low computational resources. It differentiates valid and noisy PPG signals collected from wearable devices. More details can be found in the paper.
